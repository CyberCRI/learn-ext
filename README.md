Hi ðŸ––

You're looking at the source code for WeLearn project which powers [WeLearn Browser Extension](https://ilearn.cri-paris.org).

## Components

Ideally it would be trivial to build and test this extension thanks to the build
scripts with our friendly `./panda` glue-scripts. Use `./panda help` for commands.

**Overview**

- `dev:build`: Build development version of extension. Helpful for debugging.
- `dev:server`: Run a dev server using `webpack-dev-server`
- `dev:watch`: Watch and compile as you change the source files.
- `dev:webext`: Start a `firefox` instance with the extension installed.
- `release`: Build production version, sign with mozilla extension signing service, and upload the artifacts.

  the variables depending on your requirements.
- Install JS packages using `yarn install`
- Run any of the script described above using `./panda`.

## Notes

- Extension uses `react`, you can find the components in `src` directory.
- Handlers for extension are in `src/procs` within same source file name
  as relevant `web-ext` `API` it uses (eg. runtime, background, etc.)
