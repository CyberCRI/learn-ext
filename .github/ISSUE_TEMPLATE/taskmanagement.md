##User Story:
A user

##Connecting thoughts:

Principles: 
1. Every newly added issue should have a user story to explain the pain and also the solution.
2. Think about the possible relevant issue for modifying or creating a feature, and write them down for connecting thoughts.
3. If possible, give screenshot for the problem, also the prototype in figma which fix the issue.
4. mark on the right, for possible **labels**, **projects** and **milestones**.
