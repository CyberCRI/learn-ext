I am going to explain to you how to use WeLearn.

#### Step 1. Installing Extension
First of all, let's go to our website, [welearn.cri-paris.org][website]. This is the onboarding page that you could read through to know more about current active features. WeLearn will work as an extension of the browser. We support two different ones: Firefox and Chrome. You can click the _Add to WeLearn_ button and follow the procedure to install the extension. For users who use neither Chrome nor Firefox, if it's not too much trouble, we suggest you install either one before adding the extension.

#### Step 2. Create an Account and Sign In
After adding the extension to your browser, now we can create your account. Just click on the extension button of WeLearn, and click on "sign in to add to WeLearn", it will direct you to a login page. Because WeLearn is also a part of a new global initiative, called Learning Planet, so the account that you will create is linked to it. For new users, let's register first. We simply ask you to fill your name, email address and password.

Following the registration, you should receive an verification email shortly, close this tab and check your email box to validate your account. Then you go back to log in. 

Once you log in, in [Settings][/pages/settings.html], choose the group that fits you and apply the change! 
You can also find more options in settings, about language, privacy preferences etc. I will leave you to explore these.

#### Step 3. Add Resources to WeLearn
Now you can start adding resources by clicking the WeLearn button. You can add any kind of web pages like articles, news, blog posts, etc.

I am taking the website of Learning Planet as an example, click, ![anchor button](/icons/browsers/favicon.png).
It will offer a preview and page title on the left.

Our AI will suggest some relative concepts, which you can refine by adding more concepts or removing irrelevant ones. By concept, we mean anything that has been presented as an article in wikipedia, so that all the users share a common base of understanding for words.

You can also mark how well you understand the article. This setting helps us to analyze the level of the article, which will later on contribute to a personalized recommendation system.

Finally, click "add to WeLearn", you are done.
A little tip, as our system is based on semantic analysis, it works better with texts that have over 1000 words. We're working to improve this.
If you want to check your resources right away, click on Dashboard.

#### Step 4. Check your Resource Library
As you can see, each resource card contains the basic information of the resources: preview, title, date of addition, concepts and the link. Each concept is linked to a Wikipedia page. By clicking the link at the bottom of each resource card, you can go back to its original page.

To quickly find a resource card, we suggest you use the search bar, just simply type any keywords that you memorised for it and then go! You found it.

#### Step 5. Check out your concept map
Next, when you go to "Discover" tab, you can see your concept map, which is a visualization of the knowledge span. There are three layers of the map, corresponding to your own library, your group and all users of WeLearn. The map layer of "group" displays all concepts added by the whole group members, and the map layer of "everyone" represents everything that has ever been added to WeLearn. Islands will grow along with the resources. You can zoom in and zoom out to enlarge or narrow down the scope. With a selected area, the list of concepts displays on the left bottom corner, and the resources appear under the map. 

That's it for now. Go ahead and you can start to explore WeLearn freely. Have fun!
