## What is WeLearn?
WeLearn is a web platform that lets learners:
- Index, organize, visualize and share their own learning resources and learning paths on a "map of concepts".
- Index learning resources by concepts.
- Provide recommendations for best-adapted resources and people to interact with.

## Can I delete my account?
For any reason that you want to delete your account. Please write us an email to [welearn-support@cri-paris.org][email] and we will assist you to go through the process of deletion. Notice that we will remove all the hook between target resource and your email account/user ID, however, we generally do not delete added resources from our overall database. If you have a reason that it should be deleted, please contact us.

## Does the WeLearn Browser Extension track my Browsing Activities?
No. WeLearn doesn’t track your browsing activities. WeLearn is active only when you choose to click the button and save the webpage.

## What does WeLearn do if I am reading articles in private windows?
Since WeLearn doesn’t track your browsing activities, WeLearn is only active when you click on the Add to WeLearn button. Then, we as the browser for the following informations:

- URL and Titles of the web pages where you clicked to save it through WeLearn
- The date and time of your page saving actions.
- The annotation that you marked for saved pages (such as Wikipedia concepts).
- The Difficulty Level that you click to attach the webpage.

## Why do I feel that the automatic generated concept is not accurate?
Check the length of the context. WeLearn supports context with more than 1,000 words. Less than 1,000, the autonomic generation might not work as well as expected. However, you can always delete a concept when it does not fit your expectations.
