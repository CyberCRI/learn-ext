# Tags, Personal Collections, and Curations

- Use personal tags as a way to curate or describe something.

### Anecdote / Use Case

I was looking up how to use this "Mastic Colle SuperFlex" glue. Eventually found
a datasheet for a much expensive product with similar composition to discover:

- This sort of "silicone-cauk-sealant" glues are mostly dense polymers with silicon
  atom at the end.
- Specifically, these are 'silyl-ether' functional groups with pretty cool history.

I still dont know if they'll work for my purpose though...

Anyway. Use case is simply that I use a lot of kinds of glues and most often have
to look up on the website of manufacturer. There is a classification on types, and
its quite well defined, and there are wiki pages for all. So, point is that i'd 
like to group those pages together (from a lot of different places, over time).

Usually, a bookmark with tags work perfectly. But we're humans and we forget that we
have those tags. Showing the map with suggestions for the tags/curation can be helpful.

Suggestions should be pretty good for this to work. Eg. If we see someone adding
a bunch of tags, we can do a search on their exising `PersonalTag -> Resource <- Concept`
to reduce search space as they add a bunch of tags or a bunch of resources.

Proactive tagging. Once they have created few tags, and few annotations, we can actually
start grouping their new/old resources based on statistics based on `tagged together concepts`,
`recurring website + concept pair` (eg. ian's shoelace site is quite certain to have all
its pages with something to do with shoelaces, so that would be good proxy). By proactively
suggesting users to put some resources in a `tag`, the issue with the bookmarking UX can be
measured. Note that we will not auto-commit the suggestions, instead, we'd offer a simple
solution to quickly add, or modify the suggestion. Point is that this will do a bulk of boring
tasks at once for the user. While the user benefits from the fact that they get to have
their bookmarks auto-organised.
