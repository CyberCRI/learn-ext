# Introduction

Hello there, this is Tong. Before I start, let me ask you something, have you been frustrated with too much resources to organize? Have you had trouble searching for the right resources when you need them? or just a few right keywords to start searching when you want to learn something new? 

If you have had these problems, I’d like to introduce you a powerful (gonna-be) tool that can help you. It’s called WeLearn.

WeLearn is designed to make the Web a learner-friendly space. As the first element of a global digital learning ecosystem, it will enable you to **visualize what you know**, **what you are interested in**, and help you **navigate through your own learning path**.

To improve your **personal online learning** experience, WeLearn will also help you **organize**, **index**, and **search** for relevant resources and even recommend co-learners and mentors based on matching profiles.

Now if I made you curious, let's install the WeLearn extension and explore our website for more information.


## Call for beta-testers

> Hi there, WeLearn is currently going through the developing phase, which means it is not perfect for sure, but thanks to your valuable feedback, we believe it is going to become a powerful tool for our learning planet in the future!


And right now, you have the chance, if you want to, to explore this tool and help us improve it as beta-testers! And we are super curious about how you feel and what you think about using it, so please write to us at [ilearn@cri-paris.org](mailto:ilearn@cri-paris.org).
We are very thankful for your feedback and are welcoming any opinions, remarks and advice 😊 Can’t wait to hear from you!


## How to start
Hi there, now I’m going to show you how to use WeLearn.

### Step 1. Installation
First of all, go to our official website, [ilearn.cri-paris.org](https://ilearn.cri-paris.org) and click this button to add the WeLearn extension to your web browser, if you use Chrome, click download options, here is the one for you.

And for users who use neither Chrome nor Firefox, if it’s not too much trouble, we suggest you to install either browser before adding the extension.
  

### Step 2. Sign in with email
And then we will ask you to sign in with your email address below. For group, you can just select Beta tester. After saving your email.
  

### Step 3. Add resources to WeLearn

- Now you can start adding resources by clicking the WeLearn button. They could be articles, news, blog posts, etc., as long as you read or watch them actively.
  Take this page I’m reading for an example, after I read it, click, then it’s automatically saved to WeLearn.
- On this popover, you can add or delete core concepts that are extracted from the resource.
- You can rate the difficulty level of the resource in order for us to know your level of knowledge regarding the concepts (which contributes to a personalized recommendation system.)
  And it’s done.
- You can access previously added resources by clicking on the tab “My Resources”
  Right clicking the WeLearn button also direct you to “My Resources”.

- It works better with texts that have over 1000 words.
- It does not work in PDFs, images or video just yet. (Coming soon!)
  

### Step 4. Search for resources on “My Resources”
- Here you can search for resources through concepts or keywords.
- You can also go back to the original resource by clicking the link at the bottom of each card.

### Step 5. Check out your knowledge map
- When you go to “DISCOVER”, you can see your knowledge map, which is a visualization of your knowledge span.
- For MOOC users, you will have access to a group map that displays the concepts added by the whole class.

- The number of islands represent the amount of concepts you have encountered using WeLearn.
- The altitude represents your level of knowledge about concepts.
- Grey concepts under the sea represent concepts which you haven’t added anything about.
- The map layer of “everyone” represents all concepts that have ever been added to WeLearn.


> That’s it for now 😉 Now you can go ahead and start to expand your knowledge map. Have fun!
