Hey there!

Thanks a lot for your contribution. Since this project is still very much a prototype, we'll be changing things often.

Any and all contributions are important. To give you some ideas:

- Noticed some error, bug, or anything wrong? Create a new Issue with label `Bug`.
- Want to discuss a feature? Create an issue, or write to us.
- Contributing code? Please try to discuss before opening a pull request, although it's not a requirement!
- Localisation: You can translate welearn in your language!

There are instructions for dev setup in README, and lots of documentation (search for .md files) in the repo as well.

PS: I'll update this file when we have formalised the contribution details.
